Intro
-----
* Altran is working on C++17 course (advanced).
* Next Tuesday C++17 presentatie Altran (Ghelamco arena, Gent)
* Week van 3rd october: advanced course ?

Slide 17
--------
diff between stdlib.h and cstdlib: cstdlib has namespace mechanism

Slide 25
--------
Undefined order of evaluation is going to change in C++17.

Slide 28
--------
* Reflection is coming (by people from CERN).
* Java has a better exception handling model?

Slide 35
--------
wxWidgets -> less used than Qt?

Slide 38
--------
* Secure Coding in C and C++ has website too.
* Modern C++ Design: do not start with this book, it's rather difficult.

Slide 39
--------
* 'C++ Concurrency in action' is a very good book.
* 'Real-Time C++' is very good for microcontroller programming, as an
   alternative to C (you have to get used to the book's style of writing
   code...)  It's a previously unseen style of C++ code writing.

Slide 41
--------
C++ FQA is worth looking into, just to change your perception.

Slide 56
--------
extern: no storage is allocated (it's storage is defined somewhere else).

Slide 71
--------
* References to functions is legal, but not much used, or only used for
  C-style C++...
* => is int& a; in de struct geen error? => do it in the initializer list
* In the future, there will be smart references.

Slide 74
--------
"You use a reference as you would use a value."

Slide 81
--------
operator . overloading will be possible in the future.

In most of the cases, constructor body should be empty.
Constructor only serves to initialize the member variables.  Avoid to do
work in the constructor.
E.g. do not create SerialPort in a constructor, but pass it as a reference.
If you create it in the constructor, your instance of your class *always* has
a SerialPort and its harder to fake.
Also, ORDER of initialization is important!

107
---
Complex(int real, int imaginary) is a 'Domain constructor' (term not often
used).

108
---
value-initialize to zero

Dependency Injection (just a fancy name for 'providing it to the constructor'

113
---
better error message with 'delete' instead of making private.

116
---
In modern C++ we should write less destructors.
In modern C++, we use classes that do these things for us.

117
---
Examples of resources that can leak: files, sockets, threads, locks,...

120
---
  * forget getters and setters?  Do not make them for everything.  Comes
    from Java.  Make those member variables public.
    Might be thing of the past.
    Does the outside need access to it?

129
---
Now the operators are members and they only take one argument.
Advantage: you are allowed to access private data.
Free standing operators take two.

Difference between operator+ and operator+=

Note the use of const!  Helps you at compile time!
'const' is a virus: in a const function, you can only call const functions.
In Rust, everything is const and you need to tell if you want to change it.

131
---
Inline must be in header, because you have to know what to inline.
Same for templates.

137:
'automatic' means 'automatically managed by the compiler'

139
The allocators that we have today are not the ones we had 20 years ago.
But it cannot beat a specific allocator.
Dynamic allocations can also happen in a better way than the default.
If you don't do anything special, it will use the default allocator.

140
Always think about ownership when you pass around pointers!
new might actually use malloc behind the screens.

143
---
For new code, do not use array new anymore.
There's more than one way to not have to use this anymore.

Exercise 4 Memory is very important!

Opzoeken:
  * voordeel member initializer lists?
    => Volgens Ewoud geen voordeel wegens RVO?  Zou zelfde assembler zijn?
  * CHECK slide 108: worden ze enkel in debug op 0 geinitialiseerd of niet?
  * Moet je een implementatie voorzien voor een copy constructor die je private
    maakte?
  * Zijn er classes zonder destructor?  Kan je hem private maken???  Heeft
    C++ class echt destructor nodig?
  * Zijn getters and setters slecht?
  * Is er gedefinieerd wat operators terug moeten geven?  Of kan je dat
    kiezen?
