# CppFundamentals

From June 7th, 2016 till June 10th, 2016 I followed the 'C++ Fundamentals'
course from Intelligent Systems / Altran (see
http://intelligent-systems.altran.com/core-offers/academy.html).  This
repository contains my notes for that course, my solutions for the exercises,
and also the model solutions.
